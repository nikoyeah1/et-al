=== INDEX ===

- 100% Free to use.
- Credits really appreciated <3
- Coming soon: Thiccsuki Sprite Pack 7u7

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===

1- You need the Natsuki's MPT installed first (likely on game/mod_assets/MPT)
2- Move the folder "natsuki" and the file "natsuki_layeredimage.rpy" on your MPT folder. (the system will require to replace the four natsuki_ff_nose sprites and the .rpy files, just click YES)
3- On your game, use the ffl (forward head) or fsl (sad head) commands after the "show natsuki" to make the game show the long-haired sprite (if you don't, the game will show the short-haired sprite instead)
4- DONE!
