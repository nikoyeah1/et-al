Hello! This drive contains all sprite work (+extras) I did for Kamuko. You're free to get creative with her if you plan to use her, but here are some rules.

- Do not use for commercial work. No redistributing and selling of my work. Any downloadable mods or any created content for her should be non-profit. 
- You're free to portray her character as you like as long as it doesn't promote: hurtful language, hate speech, discrimination, etc. 
- I dont allow major edits to her designs and name
- Minor edits such as outfits, accessories, etc. are allowed!
- Please credit me. [ChyChy or @chicheesticks]

Other notes.
- I made these for fun when I was 15. I don't actually know how sprites are coded into games, so sorry if they aren't so practical! (*EDIT: Thanks user BlueGodXD for tweaking the sprites for mod use!)

- She did have personality and character lore I created. Although I wont be publishing it because I'm no longer proud of it, so feel free to get creative.
Although here are some character bits she had:
- Playful, cheerful
- Gamer girl
- Had similar interests to MC (Anime, manga, etc.)
- She was never actually part of the Lit. Club. She likes hanging out after class, and her classroom just happened to be the one the Literature Club uses, making her classmates with Monika.
Fun fact: She had a girl love interest. [See in Doodles]

You dont have to adhere to these, but just thought I'd throw it in here just for the hell of it. Have fun! If you have any questions, contact me on Twitter!
